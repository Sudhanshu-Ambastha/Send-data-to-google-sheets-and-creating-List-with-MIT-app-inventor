# List and Send Data to Google Sheets App

This repository contains two MIT App Inventor projects for different use cases.

## Files

1. **list.aia**
   - This file enables users to create, update, and delete items, acting as a simple grocery list or checklist.

2. **send_data_to_google_sheets.aia**
   - This file allows users to input name and email ID, sending the data to a Google Sheet. It's ideal for collecting entries.

## How to Use

### MIT App Inventor

1. Import the desired `.aia` file into MIT App Inventor.
2. Set up your app's UI and logic as needed.
3. If using the "send_data_to_google_sheets.aia" file, replace the placeholder URLs in the app with the deployed web app URL from the associated Google Apps Script.
